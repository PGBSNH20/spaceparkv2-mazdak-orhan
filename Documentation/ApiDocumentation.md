### This markdown file will explain how the API works. We will go through each method call and how to work with the API and what to avoid

1. Once we have a docker container and image up and ready, then we can start working with the API. You can get the Docker image up and running by first, copying this entire repo, thereafter copy the filepath where dockerfile.yml and compose files are located. When you have completed these steps open your cmd and type `cd "filepath"` followed by 'Enter' button to direct your cmd to the filepath where dockerfile is located. When you are inside that directory you should type (in cmd) `docker-compose up`. When you have executed theses steps, then your database container is up and running and you're ready to start using the API.

2. Now we are ready to run the program. Run the program in your IDE (Visual studio). Since we have configured setup for Swagger there is no need to manually work with localhost URL because Swagger does that for us. So when you have done these steps, your browser should look something like this:
