- Created some objects such as Person, Starship etc. Also created two tables (Parkings and Spaceports) using EntityFrameworkCore with code first convension. 
- Started with some API methods such as GetParkings() to see who is using that parking and post for posting information on who accually is using that parking.  
- Included SWAPI ([StarwarsAPI](https://swapi.dev/)) to our project so that we can fetch and also check a specific Starwars character so that we later can include the Starwars character and its parking information in our API.
- Also gave a limit of 15 meters as max length for a spaceship. Anything below the value 15 is able to park its spaceship.
